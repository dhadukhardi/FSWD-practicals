# Practical 2: Advanced JavaScript Concepts for MERN

## Topics Covered
- Asynchronous programming: Promises and async/await
- Error handling (try...catch)
- JavaScript modules (export, import)
- Using JavaScript Date and Math objects

## Project: Task Reminder System

### Objective
Build a task reminder system that schedules reminders and handles asynchronous delays.

### Tasks
1. Create an array of task objects with fields:
   - title
   - dueTime (in minutes from now)
   - priority

2. Implement functions for:
   - Adding new tasks
   - Sorting tasks by priority
   - Displaying tasks due within a timeframe
   - Simulating reminders using setTimeout()
   - Error handling with try...catch
   - Module exports and imports

### Setup
1. Initialize the project:
```bash
npm init -y
```

2. Run the project:
```bash
node index.js
```
